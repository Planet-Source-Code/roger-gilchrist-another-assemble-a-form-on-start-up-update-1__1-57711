### Description

This is a modification/rewrite of Chris Seelbach's 'A$$emble a Form on start-up' <txtCodeId=57585>.

I have used a suggestion of Luke H in his comment on 'Dr. Fire Transparent Control' <txtCodeId=50160> to make the effect more impressive if you use XP. (it will run in earlier versions but lacks transparency).

I have also modified the code 'Capture Active Window The Inventive Way (without API calls)'<txtCodeId=33946> to allow the my code to capture a live image of the form it is pretending to assemble.

A couple of new Start and Build modes and better comments.

----

Updated: Thanks to Raul Fragoso's 'Verify if a point is inside a polygon (convex and non-convex)' <txtCodeId=32682> I have now included a version of Chris's original wedge drawing.
